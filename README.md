Yes, I Would inherit in the same way, Because I split the category of object it's a good choice to make clean code, and simple to read and maintain the code. But from the question if it uses PHP I Must reverse class position from class Aircraft -> Wing -> Flap to Flap->Wing->Aircraft Because inherited on PHP the main class in this case class aircraft must be on the bottom from another class.
Creating inherit like that can make it easy to edit or add instance variables or property and methods. And then it makes reusable because parent class have all property and method from child class
